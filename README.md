# If you want to test it on your local machine
1. First, clone the server-side project repository. Open a terminal in the directory where you want to clone the project.
2. Run `git clone 'your server repo clone link'` in the terminal.
3. Next, clone the client-side repository in the same directory using `git clone 'your client repo clone link'`.
4. After cloning both repositories, open two terminals: one for the server and one for the client.
5. In both the client and server directories, run `npm i` to install dependencies.
6. Start the server by running `npm start` in the server terminal. This will start a localhost server on port 5000.
7. In the client terminal, run `npm run dev` and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the project running
